 *
 * DOCA Communication Channel Consumer offers an extension the doca_comch channel for accelerated data transfer between
 * memory on the host and DPU in a FIFO format. An established doca_comch connection is required to negotiate the end
 * points of the FIFO. A consumer object can then post buffers to a remote process that it wishes to receive data on.
 * Completion of a consumer post receive message indicates that data has been populated from a remote producer. The
 * inter-process communication runs over DMA/PCIe and does not affect network bandwidth.
